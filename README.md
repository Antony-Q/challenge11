## Description
My challenge was to create an application called "Note Taker" that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and saves and retrieves note data from a JSON file.

The application’s front end was already created. I built the back end, connected the two, and then deployed the entire application to Heroku.
  
## Deployment  
Download the application folder. Use Terminal to navigate to the project directory and type the following: `npm start`. May require `npm install` first, if an error occurs. If you need some guidance on installing these dependencies, please refer to the links below.
